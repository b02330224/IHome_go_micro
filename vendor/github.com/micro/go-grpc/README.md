A micro gRPC framework. A simplified experience for building gRPC services. 

## Overview

**Go gRPC** makes use of [go-micro](https://github.com/micro/go-micro) plugins to create a simpler framework for gRPC development. 
It interoperates with standard gRPC services seamlessly, including the [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway). 
The go-grpc library uses the go-micro broker, client and server plugins which make use of 
[github.com/grpc/grpc-go](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go) internally. 
This means we ignore the go-micro codec and transport but provide a native grpc experience.

## Features

- **Service Discovery** - We make use of go-micro's registry and selector interfaces to provide pluggable discovery 
and client side load balancing. There's no need to dial connections, we'll do everything beneath the covers for you.

- **PubSub Messaging** - Where gRPC only provides you synchronous communication, **Go gRPC** uses the go-micro broker 
to provide asynchronous messaging while using the gRPC protocol.

- **Micro Ecosystem** - Make use of the existing micro ecosystem of tooling including our api gateway, web dashboard, 
command line interface and much more. We're enhancing gRPC with a simplified experience using micro.
